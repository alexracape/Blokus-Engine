The goal of this module is to implement the core logic for Blokus.
Eventually this will be an API that can be used in a web app that
can also interface with a Python ML model.

Roadmap:
- Create a board
- Create a piece
- Create functions for board (check_move, place_piece, etc.)
- Create basic game loop
- Create a basic web app
